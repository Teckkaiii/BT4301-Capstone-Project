🚦 BT4301 Capstone Project – Traffic Analytics with Video Analysis
📍 Project Overview

Urban areas are facing increasing traffic congestion, leading to economic losses, environmental harm, and reduced quality of life. Traditional traffic monitoring systems rely on outdated infrastructure and manual processes, making it hard to manage real-time traffic efficiently.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered traffic analytics system using computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) to detect, classify, and analyze vehicles in real time — enabling smarter traffic management and data-driven urban planning.

🎯 Objectives

🚘 Develop a real-time vehicle detection and classification system

📊 Provide traffic analytics and actionable recommendations to improve flow

🛣️ Enable multi-location surveillance to support route planning

🤖 Integrate AI model outputs into a full-stack dashboard

Success Metrics:

✅ Model accuracy ≥ 90%

✅ Traffic congestion reduced by 20%

✅ Significant cost savings from reduced manual monitoring

🛠️ Tech Stack

Machine Learning / CV: YOLO, OpenCV, Roboflow

Backend: Flask (REST API), MongoDB Atlas

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Deployment: AWS / Netlify / Vercel
